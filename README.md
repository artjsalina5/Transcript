### U.S. Navy Nuclear Personnel Training
The training regimen for U.S. Navy nuclear personnel, encompassing enlisted sailors and officers, is among the most rigorous and comprehensive in the military. My background in nuclear electronics includes the following steps:

1. **Nuclear Field A-School**  
   Completed fundamental technical training in Electronics Technician as preparation for nuclear reactor operations.

2. **Nuclear Power School (NPS)**  
   Attended a six-month intensive program in Charleston, SC, covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, nuclear reactor theory, and thermodynamics, with a focus on nuclear science and reactor operation.

3. **Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU)**  
   Underwent hands-on training at an operational nuclear reactor facility, applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

4. **Onboard Training and Qualification**  
   After the NPTU, served on nuclear-powered submarines, including the fast attack submarine fleet, and qualified on the **S9G reactor plant** as a supervisory reactor operator. This involved rigorous exams and practical demonstrations of competence in managing the ship’s reactor department.

## Academic Projects

### HuskyStressMonitor Project  
Developing a real-time stress monitoring system using physiological sensors, such as **Empatica E4** and **Hexoskin**. The project involves multiplexing signals from various digital human monitoring devices, including **ECG, HRV, and respiratory rate estimation**. Reverse-engineered Bluetooth HLE bitstreams are processed in real-time on **ESP32 RTOS**, with integration of **tensor processing hardware** for predictive analytics. The system is designed for **submarine training environments**, providing holistic crew health status by fusing multiple physiological sensor inputs. 

### Advanced Music Rehearsal and Education Tool  
Creating a multi-microphone and camera-based rehearsal tool to **capture, synchronize, and process rehearsal sessions** for playback, analysis, and educational feedback on a web platform. The tool includes a **data fusion system** to combine audio and video streams, allowing conductors and section leaders to identify and highlight problem areas. Designed to enhance rehearsal efficiency, the system integrates features for feedback, session review, and **section-specific streams** for focused rehearsal improvement.

### FPGA Digital Design and Driver Development  
Utilized **FPGAs from Lattice and Cologne Chip** to develop expertise in **digital design, look-up tables, and driver development**. This project focused on understanding low-level hardware design principles and **signal processing** using FPGA technology, contributing to efficient hardware integration in complex systems.

### StarFive VisionFive2 SBC Development  
Leveraged the **StarFive VisionFive2 SBC** to explore **RISC-V 64-bit ISA** and compiler development. This project involved low-level system design and **embedded systems programming**, focusing on building compilers and optimizing the **RISC-V architecture** for performance in real-world applications.
